\begin_layout Subsubsection
Absolute positioning with electromagnets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An initial idea of robot positioning was to use two electromagnets generating two 
separate magnetic fields, strong enough to cover a large enough area of interest 
(maybe 2x2 m). By shifting these fields on and off, we were hoping to extract 
field-vectors of these fields with a magnetic sensor (compass), and triangulate the 
position of the robot by calculating the direction of the magnetic source. 
This ambitious concept proved hard to realize for numerous reasons, and would probably 
been a much larger project than what we were about to execute - on its own. 

About the idea
To cover the area required with a sufficient field, we first looked on the market 
for purchasing an already existing electromagnet. However, we soon realized that 
the strength of the fields they generated was not adequate for our needs. To get 
enough strength we had to build our own electromagnets. By letting an iron core be 
equiped with with some houndred laps of wire, and letting a strong current flow 
through it, we figured that a large enough magnetic field for our needs could be 
obtained. To get a position from the field vectors we hoped to be able to obtain 
through the magnetic sensors, available in the LEGO Mindstorm kit, we needed to 
switch the two magnetic fields on and off separately. This because otherwise these 
field vectors would have merged into a single one, with a complicated structure. To 
get a good measurement of the generated field vector we wanted to have them at least 
twice as large as Earths magnetic field, over the whole arena. 
After running some calculations for our hypothetical electromagnets, we were forced 
abandon this sub-project, since they showed that the size of the field the 
electromagnets were required to regenerate far exceeded what reasonably could have 
been achieved with available equipment. Another reason to throw this idea in the 
trashbin, was the magnetic sensors from LEGO that did not give good enough 
measurements for one with our ambitions for application, to be satisfied. A bad 
sensor with fluctuating readings would easily dismantle the purpose of the system, 
by giving the sensitive system a high rate wrong values, and make the calculations 
for the estimated position disastrous.

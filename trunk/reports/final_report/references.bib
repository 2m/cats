  abstract = {{This paper deals with a cooperative object tracking with mobile robotic
	sensor network. The occlusion problem, which is one of the most important
	problems of mobile object tracking, will be solve with utilizing
	the mobile robotic sensor network. Additionally, the high quality
	information of the object can be observed, since the robotic sensor
	network can change observation formation their own way. On the other
	hand, to solve these problems the high cognitive capability and high
	intelligence sharing ability of robots are required. Consequently,
	we propose to use high intelligent group robot each of which can
	communicate with Peer-to-Peer communication. The self-deployment
	algorithm and network routing algorithm are developed as a base technic
	of mobile sensor network. The validity of these proposed algorithms
	are shown by multihop teleoperation experiment. The architecture
	to share common perceptions which is necessary for cooperative work
	are proposed.}},

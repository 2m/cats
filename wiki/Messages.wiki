#Messages that need to be sent over the network.

= Messages for the Unscented Kalman Filter =

Probably only one big message needed:

{id (int), t (int), angle_m (f), x_m (f), y_m (f), v_xm (f), v_ym (f), x_c (f), y_c (f), v_xc (f), vy_m (f), angle_c (f), rel_angle_cam (f), seen_landmarks (int(4)), sees_mouse (boolean) }

Notes:

  * id = id of the cat
  * t = time stamp of when angle_m was measured
  * angle_m = angle measurement of the mouse (relative to the map)
  * x_m = x position of the mouse
  * y_m = y position of the mouse
  * v_xm = x component of velocity of the mouse
  * v_ym = y component of velocity of the mouse
  * x_c = x position of the cat
  * y_c = y position of the cat
  * v_xc = x component of velocity of the cat
  * v_yc = y component of velocity of the cat
  * angle_c = orientation of the cat (relative to the map)
  * rel_angle_cam = orientation of the camera relative to the cat
  * seen_landmarks = landmarks currently within the view of the cat
  * sees_mouse = if the cat currently sees the mouse


= Messages for the Particle Filter =

Send measurement:

{id (int), t (int), angle_m (f), x_c (f), y_c (f)}

Notes:
Will be sent by each cat during each iteration

Send result:

{id (int), t (int), x_m (f), y_m (f), v_xm (f), v_ym (f), covar (f(6)) weight (f)}

= Introduction =

We need to find a feasible solution to our problem. Here our different approaches and preliminary results are presented. All sub projects have owners that are responsible for delivering a viable solution (if it can be found) until _Friday 2010-03-01_.

The solution proposed does only have to be feasible, we can not know which one will be best until after simulation.
